# lean-canvas

Project scope:
==============
* A simple mobile application consisting of four dialogues, for listing/opening, viewing, editing, and deleting [lean canvases](http://ask.leanstack.com/business-model-design-fundamentals/concepts-and-definitions/what-is-a-lean-canvas).
* Works on Chrome for Android [turns out to work perfectly with Edge as well, not tested with Firefox].
* Can be used entirely offline.
* Satisfies all requirements needed to support installing to the home screen of a device (app manifest, icons, service worker, etc).
* Lets the user export and download a canvas as a json file, just in case the future wants it.


Implementation:
===============
PouchDB is used to store the canvases as individual objects indexed by a UUIDv4 generated by PouchDB when doing a db.push().

HTML, CSS and Javascript is kept in one file with the exception of the service worker that is requried to be loaded as a separate file, and the dependencies PouchDB, Roboto and Material-icons.

The canvas documents stored in the database are given key names that correspond to the IDs of html elements in the "view" and "edit" dialgoues of the app. This allows writing to the database doc with a loop that traverses the html elements and fills the correspondingly named fields in the database doc with their content (and vice versa for reading).

The database doc currently worked on is stored in its entirety as a global (named "canvas") giving access to its fields, its _id and its _rev throughout the applications dialogues. This global object then contains the complete state of the app.

One rule for valid html5 is broken where multiple elements (exactly two of each) contain the same ID. This regards one set of elements in the "view" dialogue having the same IDs as one set of elements in the "edit" dialogue. These elements are never visible or active on the page at the same time and browsers showed no problems handling it. The simplicity that this design decision awarded the javascript code, made me choose to keep it this way.
